**ChatServerClientBot - Java Socket Chatbot**


This repository contains a simple socket server chatbot implemented in Java. The project demonstrates basic socket programming concepts by creating a server that listens for client connections and responds to messages sent by the client. The server echoes back the received messages with a "Server: " prefix, providing a straightforward example of client-server communication.

Features:
		**Server:** Listens for client connections on a specified port and handles incoming messages.
		**Client:** Connects to the server, sends messages, and receives responses.
		**Socket Programming:** Utilizes Java's ServerSocket and Socket classes for network communication.
		**Multi-threading:** Can be extended to handle multiple clients concurrently.

**Usage:**
		**Run the Server:** Start the server by running the ChatServer class.
		**Run the Client:** Connect to the server by running the ChatClient class and send messages to interact with the server.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the basics of socket programming and client-server architecture in Java. Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code to suit your needs!
